A quick proof of concept using websockets, google maps, and kinesis to update realtime(ish) locations. To run it you'll need to have your '.aws/credentials' set up or be on a machine with a role that can access kinesis.  You'll also need a kinesis stream.  ATM it's coded to 'pctest', but you'll probably want to change that.  After 'npm install', run it with 'node server.js' and then point a browser at 'http://localhost:3000/map'.  To actually see it work you will need to feed some data into the kinesis stream.  I've provided a 'feeder' and an example file that you can use to send data to the stream.  Run the feeder by cd'ing into the feeder directory, run `npm install` and `node feeder.js demoLocations.tab 2`.  See the feeder README for more info.
